# Language design doc


# Raw ideas
1. Multipadigm language. Should support Object oriented paradimg as well as functional in some way. (Something like Go/Rust)
2. Static typing. Should be staticly typed
3. Compiled. JIT Compilation
4. Basic tooling. Super basic tolling should be implemented: debugger, package magager, documentation tools
5. Bootstrapping. Rewrite compiler on language itself*
