Learning programming language implementation


**Alcor** is a learning-oriented programming language project designed to explore the core concepts of interpreters and compilers. It serves as a practical introduction to building programming languages from scratch, emphasizing the theoretical and practical aspects of language design and implementation.

## Project Goals

- **Learn Core Concepts**: Understand the steps of creating interpreters and compilers.
- **Experimentation**: A sandbox for testing ideas in language design.
- **Minimalistic Design**: Start simple and expand as new concepts are learned.

## Key Milestones

1. Implement a basic interpreter.
2. Extend the interpreter with advanced features like scopes and type checking.
3. Transition to a basic compiler.
4. Experiment with optimizations and bytecode generation.

## Example

```alcor
function main() {
    print("Hello, Alcor!");
}
